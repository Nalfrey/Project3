PROJECT 3 TITLE
This file is just a template that you can use for your project proposal and your README.md. Not every section is needed for your proposal and not every section is needed for the final README.md for submission. I recommend having TWO SEPARATE files, one for your project proposal and one for the README.md for the final GitHub submission.

Topic
Project proposal and submission: A brief description of the topic that you chose.
Project submission only: any background that is relevant

Dataset
Project proposal and submission: Dataset source, link, and high level description. A screenshot of the metadata (if it exists).
Project submission only: Links to documentation/code for the new package/library you found.

Project Inspiration & Initial Design
Project proposal and submission: Three or four screenshots of relevant, “inspiring” visualizations that show your creative ideas (visualization track only)
Project proposal and submission: A sketch of the initial design

GitHub Link
Project proposal only: A link to the primary GitHub repository where you’ll be housing your work.

Ethical Considerations
Project submission only: At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project

Repository Structure
Project submission only: Instructions on how to use and interact with the project
